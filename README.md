## Description

---

Fitness Nuts allows users to register and keep track of their physical condition and find workouts to do! Users will be able to see their age, weight, and height in their profile, and then find a workout at random to get their fitness routine started. The randomized workout helps keeps the userâ€™s routine different and unexpected, rather than following the same workout set week after week.

Future updates: More workouts, the ability to update age, and weight, and feature to select workouts based on time duration.
